There are less NA players competing in the top-tier of competitions, less organizations competing with North American-based rosters, and less young players coming into the scene to keep it stoked with talent for years to come. In the same interview, Twistzz described the current state of NA&nbsp;<em>CS:GO<\/em>&nbsp;as \u201cabysmal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>There are only three prominent organizations competing in or near the top tier of&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;<\/em>with North American rosters: Team Liquid, Evil Geniuses, and Complexity. Twistzz himself is in a very unique situation; he is the only North American player competing at the highest level as part of a European roster.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Many of the NA&nbsp;<em>VALORANT<\/em>&nbsp;scene is decorated with players who played in the first or second tier of NA&nbsp;<em>CS:GO<\/em>, but many of them feel that they were forced out, and take issue with Twistzz\u2019s comments. Cloud9\u2019s in-game leader Anthony \u201cvanity\u201d Malaspina said that he and his Chaos teammates \u201cwent from looking for apartments to get better ping to being orgless within a 2 week period.\u201d This came after he led Chaos to a wealth of domestic success during the 2020 season, but the organization still released the roster and left&nbsp;<em>CS:GO&nbsp;<\/em>at the start of the next year.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">we went from looking for apartments to get better ping to being orgless within a 2 week period(nothing against the chaos owners\/managers that&#39;s just esports).

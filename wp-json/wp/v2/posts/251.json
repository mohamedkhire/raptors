FURIA, one of the Brazilian representatives, took down G2 in the 2-2 pool of the Legends Stage\u2019 Swiss system format today.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The series kicked off on Vertigo, FURIA\u2019s map pick. The Brazilian squad won it 16-12 thanks to an impressive performance on the CT side of the map. The action moved to Inferno and it could have gone either way, but G2 defeated FURIA 16-14 after Audric \u201cJACKZ\u201d Jug denied a one-vs-three clutch attempt from Kaike \u201cKSCERATO\u201d Cerato, which would have taken the map to overtime.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>G2 had a good chance to win the series after they won the first half of Ancient 10-5. Their odds increased after they won the anti-eco and broke FURIA\u2019s CT side economy early in the second half. The match would have gone differently if Andrei \u201carT\u201d Piovezan didn\u2019t flank G2\u2019s players with the automatic pistol CZ-75 right after and got away with three decisive kills. ArT\u2019s play changed the momentum of the game and FURIA went on to win nine consecutive rounds after that, thus closing out Ancient 16-11.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"pt\" dir=\"ltr\">por todos os dias acordando cedo, pelo celular escondido dentro do estojo, pela fugidinha do trabalho pra assistir apoiar o Brasil, ESTAMOS L\u00c1 DE NOVO! <br><br>N\u00d3S CONSEGUIMOS, BRASILEIRINHO!<br><br>POR VOC\u00caS<br>COM VOC\u00caS<br>SOMOS GIGANTES! \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7<br><br>E \u00c9 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DIADEFURIA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DIADEFURIA<\/a> NESSA P#RRA <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/bDAM979hhz\">pic.twitter.com\/bDAM979hhz<\/a><\/p>&mdash; FURIA @ PGL Major Antwerp \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea (@FURIA) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FURIA\/status\/1526615932151508992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>ArT\u2019s highlight had an impressive impact on the series, but the best player on FURIA was KSCERATO. The star rifler finished the series with 63 kills and 54 deaths, plus an 80.5 ADR, and was the highest-rated player of the match (1.16 rating), tied with G2\u2019s Ilya \u201cm0NESY\u201d Osipov.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>While this match secured FURIA a spot in the playoffs, it also means that G2 are out of the competition. The international superteam made it into the grand finals of last year\u2019s Major but didn\u2019t qualify for the playoffs this time with the additions of m0NESY, in-game leader Aleksi \u201cAleksib\u201d Virolainen, and head coach R\u00e9my \u201cXTQZZZ\u201d Quoniam.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The Legends Stage of the PGL Antwerp Major will conclude today after Imperial and Copenhagen Flames play for the last Champions Stage spot.

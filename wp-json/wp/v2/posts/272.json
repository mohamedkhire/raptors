The tournament was supposed to be organized by ESL, though, it was canceled due to COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The event, however, was canceled after the in-game capsules had already been on sale. As the report states, Tim \u201cnawwk\u201d Jonasson, who was an active player of the NiP roster at the time, \u201cbelieves they have a contractual claim to the earnings from the sticker sales,\u201d which hasn\u2019t been paid to the players.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>And the amount of money that is supposed to be withdrawn to each player is said to be from $200,000 to $300,000. The report explains nawwk is aiming to take legal action against the organization in order to get it to pay the money it owes to the individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Nawwk\u2019s claim is said to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/m7fux8q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">held in section 5.4 of their player contracts<\/a>, which says each player \u201cshall receive 100% of the individual stickers money, which is allocated to the players.\u201d Additionally, individuals are expected to be given 83.33 percent of the team stickers money, divided between them.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The report also provides a response from Jonas \u201ccalc\u201d Gundersen, NiP\u2019s Chief Operating Officier, which was supposedly sent to the players in a group text chat. According to the report, he said: \u201cThese were \u2018Capsules\u2019 created by the teams, and Ok\u2019d by Valve, in order to survive the pandemic and keep paying salaries without any cuts, despite the complete lack of sponsorships and exposure,\u201d it reads. \u201cTherefore it\u2019s not stickers as it would be normally \u2013 because there was no major. This was a desperation move for many teams because elseway something like half would have pulled out of CS:GO altogether.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Gundersen follows by explaining he knows many teams had a different approach to this topic, with some paying \u201cportions out to the players.\u201d NiP, though, decided not to do that and \u201ckeep salaries and business\u201d running as usual, likely due to the money earned through the stickers. The goal of these actions was to support the infrastructure within the organization to \u201cmake it an even better place to win majors.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, the report claims three players from that time, Fredrik \u201cREZ\u201d Sterner, Nicolas \u201cPlopski\u201d Gonzalez Zamora, and Hampus \u201champus\u201d Poser, don\u2019t wish to talk about the topic to the public.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Ninjas in Pyjamas has been in a similar spotlight in the past. The outlet adds that in 2015, the organization owed $340,000 in sticker sales and prize money, which resulted in Per Lilliefelth, the CEO back then, leaving NiP.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Currently, NiP\u2019s&nbsp;<em>CS:GO<\/em>&nbsp;division is participating in PGL Antwerp Major, where it qualified for the Champions Stage, which begins on Thursday, May 19.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ninjas in Pyjamas is allegedly in dispute with some of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":290,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/272"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=272"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/272\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/290"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=272"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=272"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/monk-theme.pxsquad.com\/demo2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=272"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
